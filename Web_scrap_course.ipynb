      "I am seeking two separate Smartphone college \"intern\" developers. One to focus on Android and the other on iOS. The task is to integrate two existing separate Smartphone versions of the same app. The apps are both connected to a php/server using a standard RESTful API protocol. The existing apps are well written but basically undocumented. \n",
      "The goal it to modify them so that they will connect to a standard, but private, LINUX server environment. \n",
      "At least in the initial effort, there will not be a lot of original programming involved. Therefore, due diligence and the ability to research and understand the fairly large code base of the specific Smartphone type, are key.\n",
      "I have completed quite a bit of preliminary analysis. I will provide that information to help with defining the areas of focus.\n",
      "The intern must fully understand how to publish and test the Apps using the respective Play stores. \n",
      "The Android app is written using Android Studio in Java while the iOS code is written in Swift.\n",
      "You will be reporting to, me, a senior computer scientist who will manage the backend while you manage the respective Smartphone app. \n",
      "The pay is at the “intern” level of $10 per hour with a budget of $600 per Smartphone. The project is targeted for completion prior to Christmas school break. However, there is the possibility of you being on the ground floor of a unique and major economic success. \n",
      "The source code is under a private Git repo. A Non-Disclosure Agreement is required.\n",
      "In summary:\n",
      "1.\tYou must already be fluent in the specific Smartphone’s Code\n",
      "2.\tYou must already know how to publish an Android or iPhone app\n",
      "3.\tYou must be capable of accepting stringent reviews and carrying out directions.\n",
